<h2>Settings/Instructions</h2>
<p>Play with the settings to create the colors & shades you need for your project. Some seed colors work better than others, and some setting combinations do not produce the most aesthitic results.</p>
<p>Try varying hue, saturation, and lightness to get the shades & ranges you're looking for.</p>
<p>Try slight modications to existsing palettes to intuitively understand the system before attempting to create your own from scratch.</p>
<h3>Color Intensity</h3>
<p>Setting this to 0 will cause it to be greyscale, and setting it to 12 will cause bright, vivid colors.</p>
<h3>Color Contrast</h3>
<p>How "far apart" the first three colors are.</p>
<p>Setting it to 0 will cause it be 3 close shades of the same color</p>
<p>Moving it further in either direction will increase the contrast both in hue & in brightness.</p>
<p>Setting it close to 0 will result in 3 very close shades.</p>
<p>Moving the bar to the right will cause the colors to "spin" right on the color wheel. The secondary color gets a little darker and desaturated, and the highlight gets much lighter and saturated.</p>
<p>Moving the bar to the left will cause the colors to "spin" left on the color wheel. The secondary gets a little brighter and saturated, and the highlight gets much darker and desaturated.</p>
<p>In general, the "Highlight" color changes at a much faster rate than "secondary", so it will usually be more contrasting, except for when it completes it loop around the color wheel (at +/- 13.5, 27, 40.5).</p>
<h3>Color Spin Directions</h3>
<p>These are the master controls on the "spin" direction. Setting it the middle is turning off the hue change, so only brightness change. When to the right, the colors are aligned with the description above, but switching them to the left will "reverse" the direction for that color.</p>
<h3>Lightness</h3>
<p>Sets the overall lightness of the colors.</p>
<h3>Lightness contrast</h3>
<p>Sets the contrast in lightness between the lightest & darkest shade of a color, and the diffrence between white, black, and the color. Setting this to 0 will produce a very flat color scheme, with no difference in lights and darks. Setting it to 12 will result in a "cartoon" scheme with little shades, but bold lights and darks. Halfway will produce a more realistic variety.
